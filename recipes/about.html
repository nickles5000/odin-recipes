            <p>
                My name is Nick.<br>
                Odin was basically the Norse mythology equivalent of  Zeus. That answers the first question.<br> 
                But I have no idea if he was a good cook or not.<br> 
                <strong>THAT'S NOT WHAT'S IMPORTANT!</strong><br>
                I need you to focus.<br> 
                Ok, so I’m learning how to code and build websites using the online source at TheOdinProject.org.<br>
                This is one of my assignments.<br>
                That’s why there’s an Odin connection to this whole thing. You see?<br>
                What I'm hoping is that you enjoy what i've done here.<br>  
            </p>
            <p2>
                P.S. There's a recipe for a bologna cake on here. Don't eat that.
            </p2>
