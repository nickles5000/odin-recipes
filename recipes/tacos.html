    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2> 
    <p>Here we go. These aren't the best tacos you've ever had. But if you're hungry, they'll make you stop being hungry.<br>
       I taught myself this recipe through sheer will and the desire to eat tacos that taste just like they were made using<br>
       a packet of Ortega, without any of the hassle of having to buy 3 or 4 packets of Ortega each week.

    <p>
        I recommend putting as little thought into these as possible. That defeats the purpose of this totally non-traditional<br>
        abomination of a well loved dish. You're gonna want to throw the meat in the pan with some chopped onions and just let<br>
        it all cook while you watch your stories. Have you seen the new Netflix show about the weird priest on the fishing island?<br>
        Good stuff. Three snaps in a Z formation.
    </p>   
    <p>
        When your beef is done browning, just throw the rest of the ingredients in the pan and turn up the burner to medium high.<br>
        When that bad boy starts bubbling turn it down to a "grandma's simmer" where there is a nice slow bubbliness to it. After<br>
        20 minutes you should have a pan full of Cali-Mexi-Texi-lower Missouri inspired "taco" meat. Add it to your favorite kind<br>
        of tortilla and enjoy. I know I will.
