    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2> 
    <p>
        Some of my fondest memories involve hot summer days in Arkansas sitting on a porch and enjoying some ice cold bologna<br>
        cake. The sweetness from the icing and the salty greasiness of the bologna create a flavor combination that would make<br>
        Thomas Keller roll over in his grave. What? Chef Keller isn't dead? Now he is.

        I know you'll be tempted to skip out on the olives on this one as they only appear to be part of the decoration but they<br>
        they are, in fact, a key ingredient. The brine adds a little joie de vivre to the dish that would certainly be missed if<br>
        they were to be omitted. If you don't have any olives it would be worth your while to have little Johnny pick some up when<br>
        you send him to the market to get your Pall Malls.

        I've posted my grandma's recipe here just the way she used to make it. We would always enjoy a slice (or ten) of this delicious<br>
        cake after one of here famous dinners featuring Pineapple Meat Stick and Mayonnaise Salad.
